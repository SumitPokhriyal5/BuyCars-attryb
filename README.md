# Buy Cars

The project is a MERN web application called **BuyCars**, which serves as a marketplace for second-hand cars. Users can buy and sell cars on the platform. The application includes features for user authentication, car listing, filtering, editing, and deleting.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to the application to access the full functionality.
- **Car Listing**: Dealers can add their second-hand cars to the platform by providing details such as car model, year, price, colors, mileage, power, and maximum speed.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter cars based on price, colors, and mileage to find the desired cars more efficiently.
- **Car Editing and Deleting**: Dealers have the ability to edit and delete their listed cars to keep the inventory up to date.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, TypeScript, SCSS) and follows a client-server architecture.
